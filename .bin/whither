# Whither [my disk space]?
#
# Run this to find out where your disk space is going. Pass the paths that
# you're curious about as arguments. It will tell you:
#
#   * The total size of each path (rounded up to the nearest megabyte).
#   * How many files exist in each path. You want to minimize this to speed up
#     backups (e.g., if you have 100 projects, each with a 200,000-file
#     node_modules directory, then your backups will be terribly slow.)
#
# The list will be sorted in increasing order of total size, so you can simply
# look at the bottom of the output to see the largest files/directories.
#
# For example:
#
#   $ whither ~/*
#   a       b       c
#   Size    Files   Name
#   1M      2       lib
#   1M      39      bin
#   3M      747     notes
#   610M    62124   src
#   5659M   126892  proj
#   306976M 49      Downloads
#
# Remember: expansion of globs (*, ?, {}, etc.) is done by the shell, before
# commands are invoked, so this command can use them for free (like all
# commands!)
#
#   $ whither ~/{src,proj}/*
#   Size    Files   Name
#   1M      53      /Users/grb/proj/thelongpoll
